###  MyPay is a fictious mobile banking system (iOS), inspired by today's popular solutions (mainly Revolut app or Moje ING).
### The app represents a practical part of the bachelor thesis - "Basic mobile banking functionalities in iOS system applications" by Konrad Rybicki (all rights reserved).
### The project itself has not yet been finished, but it will possibly be extended furthermore, for educational purposes or just for fun :)
### IMPORTANT: To anyone checking out the repository in purpose of professional activity reconaissance - please bare in mind, that the project was being created under strong time pressure, and there is lots of things that could've been done better, i.e.:<br/>- present error fixes<br/>- code refactorisation<br/>- code optimalisation<br/>- auto layout<br/>- interface improvements<br/>- ~~monolithical~~ modular architecture
